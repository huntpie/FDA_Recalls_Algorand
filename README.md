# FDA_Recalls_Algorand

Python script to be automated in the cloud to pull Food Recall data daily

Convert data into readable JSON Array

Encode JSON into uint8 array (if this is possible, apologies new to programming)

Place Encoded file into txn note

Send a payment txn to receiver address

Use indexer from Algorand

Future implementations

1. Decentralize the python script location and FDA data storage before Algo txn
2. Add other Recalls such as drug recalls
