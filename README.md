# FDA_Recalls_Algorand

Python script to be automated in the cloud to pull Food Recall data daily

Then send multiple transactions with notefields of data from FDA Open API

Use indexer from Algorand to combine all transaction notefields

Future implementations

1. Decentralize the FDA data storage before Algo txn
2. Add other Recalls such as drug recalls
